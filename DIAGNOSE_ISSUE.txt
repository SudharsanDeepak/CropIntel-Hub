DIAGNOSE YOUR NETWORK ERROR ISSUE
====================================================================

You're seeing "Network error. Please check your connection."

This means the mobile app CANNOT reach the backend server.

====================================================================
CHECKLIST - Answer these questions:
====================================================================

QUESTION 1: Did you deploy the backend to Render?
--------------------------------------------------
After I made the CORS fix, you MUST deploy it to Render.

To check:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find service: cropintel-hub-bnd
3. Look at "Latest Deploy" timestamp
4. Is it from TODAY (March 1, 2026)?

If NO → You MUST deploy the backend first!
If YES → Continue to Question 2

QUESTION 2: Did you rebuild the APK?
-------------------------------------
After I made the axios fix, you MUST rebuild the APK.

To check:
- Did you run .\BUILD_MOBILE_APP_FINAL.bat?
- Did you install the NEW APK on your device?
- Did you uninstall the old app first?

If NO → You MUST rebuild and reinstall!
If YES → Continue to Question 3

QUESTION 3: Is the backend actually running?
---------------------------------------------
Open browser and go to:
https://cropintel-hub-bnd.onrender.com/health

Do you see JSON with "status": "ok"?

If NO → Backend is down or sleeping, wait 60 seconds and try again
If YES → Continue to Question 4

QUESTION 4: Can you access the backend from your phone?
--------------------------------------------------------
On your phone's browser, go to:
https://cropintel-hub-bnd.onrender.com/health

Do you see JSON with "status": "ok"?

If NO → Your phone can't reach the backend (network/firewall issue)
If YES → There's a CORS or app configuration issue

====================================================================
MOST LIKELY CAUSE:
====================================================================

Based on your error, the most likely cause is:

**BACKEND NOT DEPLOYED WITH CORS FIX**

The CORS fix is in the GitHub code but NOT deployed to Render yet.

====================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
====================================================================

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Login to your account
3. Find service: "cropintel-hub-bnd"
4. Click "Manual Deploy"
5. Select "Deploy latest commit"
6. Wait for "Deploy succeeded" (2-5 minutes)

Then:
7. Run: .\BUILD_MOBILE_APP_FINAL.bat
8. Install new APK on device
9. Test again
